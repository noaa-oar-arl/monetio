Observations
******************

This section will aid in how to use MONET to load observational datasets available.

First we will import several libraries to aid for in the future.

.. code::   python

    import numpy as np          # numpy
    import pandas as pd         # pandas
    from monet.obs import *     # observations from MONET
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # plotting
    import seaborn as sns       # better color palettes
    import cartopy.crs as ccrs  # map projections
    import cartopy.feature as cfeature # politcal and geographic features
